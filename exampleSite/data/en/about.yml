    content: "We design and deploy automated data fusion tools to make sense of the
      world - both online and off. We map the political, economic, social, environmental
      and digital layers of a problem to help clients reduce uncertainty and identify
      opportunity. \n\nOur predictive data analytics are helping cities from Amsterdam
      to Los Angeles recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our digital harm detection
      systems are shaping the UN responses to on-line harms and disinformation from
      in South and Central Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.\n"

      We are as comfortable speaking in the boardroom of Fortune 500 companies and on the mainstage of the World Economic Forum's annual conference in Davos as with warlords in Afghanistan and wildcat miners in the Amazon. We are TED speakers, columnists and filmmakers, and best selling authors.

      Our team delivers executive talks, training and mentorship to executives from leading tech companies, international organizations, and global cities. We help our clients diagnose digital risks, unlock new opportunities, discover value in data and build resilience
