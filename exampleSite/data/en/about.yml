      diagnose digital threats, unlock new opportunities, and generate value by converting

      We are as comfortable speaking in the boardroom of Fortune 500 companies and on the mainstage of the World Economic Forum's annual conference in Davos as with warlords in Afghanistan and wildcat miners in the Amazon. We are TED speakers, columnists and filmmakers, and best selling authors.

      Our team delivers executive talks, training and mentorship to executives from leading tech companies, international organizations, and global cities. We help our clients diagnose digital risks, unlock new opportunities, discover value in data and build resilience
