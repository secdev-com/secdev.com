    content: '"Yesterday I received Terra Incognita: I was planning just to have a
      first look at it in the evening, but became so fascinated and engaged that I
      ended up staying up to read it until 1.00 AM. I am wholly impressed by the comprehensive
      approach it takes. Itâ€™s a book which truly deserves great public attention as
      it explains cause and effect relationships in such a clear manner." '

    content: '"This is really an extraordinary book. Absolutely beautiful, but more
      importantly, it really does open new ways of seeing the world. Indispensable
      for teachers of many different kinds, as well as presenters who want dramatic
      images.  Terra Incognita simultaneously shows us how much of our world we can
      see and map and how many dark places still remain to be explored. Most important,
      it is a vital tool for teaching students, researchers, and analysts how to change
      our mental models -- our imagined maps -- of the worlds we think we inhabit.
      Our future depends on it." '
