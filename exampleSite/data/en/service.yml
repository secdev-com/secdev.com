      We design and deploy automated data fusion tools to make sense of the world - both online and off. We map the political, economic, social, environmental and digital layers of a problem to help clients reduce uncertainty and identify opportunity.

      Our predictive data analytics are helping cities from Amsterdam to Los Angeles recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our digital harm detection systems are shaping the UN responses to on-line harms and disinformation from in South and Central Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.

      We are as comfortable speaking in the boardroom of Fortune 500 companies and on the mainstage of the World Economic Forumâ€™s annual conference in Davos as with warlords in Afghanistan and wildcat miners in the Amazon. We are TED speakers, columnists and filmmakers, and best selling authors.

      Our team delivers executive talks, training and mentorship to executives from leading tech companies, international organizations, and global cities. We help our clients diagnose digital risks, unlock new opportunities, discover value in data and build resilience
